/*
 * 64. Minimum Path Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/
 *
 * Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top
 * left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its
 * path.
 *
 * Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
 * Output: 12
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - m == grid.length
 * - n == grid[i].length
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * - 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
